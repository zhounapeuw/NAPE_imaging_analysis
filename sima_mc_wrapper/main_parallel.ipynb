    "# NAPE Calcium Imaging Preprocessing Pipeline\n",
    "\n",
    "Finds any .tif, .tiff, .h5 files in the requested directory and performs SIMA-based motion correction and fft-based bidirection \n",
    "offset correction, signal extraction, and neuropil correction. This code parallelizes the computation at the session level by passing the multiple file paths (if there are more than one recordings) to the multiprocessing map function. \n",
    "\n",
    "__IMPORTANT RECOMENDATION__: This pipeline requires the user to manually draw regions-of-interest (ROIs) on the mean image (usually the motion-corrected output). If ROIs have not been drawn, it is recommended to use option 2 below (using files_to_analyze.py) and perform the preprocessing in two runs/executions of this code (main_parallel). For the __first run__, perform only the motion correction step. Take the H5 motion-corrected output and load it into FIJI (https://imagej.net/Fiji), manually draw ROIs, and save the ROIs. Then (__second run__) edit files_to_analyze.py now setting signal_extraction and neuropil_correction to True, and rerun this notebook/script (main_parallel).\n",

    "How to run this code\n",
    "------------------------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "__In this jupyter notebook, just run all cells in order (shift + enter). When you reach the last cell, it will prompt the user for input. You have two options:__\n",
    "\n",
    "1) __Input the path to the root directory__ that contains the raw files. For example, if your files are in a folder called analyze_sessions: C:\\Users\\my_user\\analyze_sessions  \n",
    "This will by default attempt to run motion correction, signal extraction, and neuropil extraction. You will encounter an error if ROI masks are not saved to the same directory as the raw data.\n",
    "\n",
    "2) You can also indicate specific files, parameters, and processing steps to include by __editing the python script called files_to_analyze.py__ (in the same directory as this main_parallel.ipynb). Once you have specified the files in files_to_analyze.py and saved, run this notebooks' cells, leave the input blank, and press enter; this code will automatically load the information in files_to_analyze.py.\n",

    "To execute this in command line and follow the same directions as above:  \n",

    "-----------------\n",
    "Python 2.7, sima, glob, multiprocessing, numpy, h5py, pickle (optional if want to save displacement file) \n",

    "Custom code requirements: sima_motion_correction, bidi_offset_correction, calculate_neuropil (written by Vijay Namboodiri), files_to_analyze\n",
